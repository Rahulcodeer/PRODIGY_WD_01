This Weather App is a web-based application that fetches and displays weather data based on the user's location or a user-inputted location. The app utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve current weather conditions, temperature, and other relevant information.

To get started with this Weather App, you need a modern web browser. First, download the project files and navigate to the project directory. Open the index.html file in your web browser to start using the app. The main files include index.html for the structure, styles.css for styling, and script.js for the weather-fetching logic.

The app provides an input field for users to enter a location and a button to fetch the weather data for the specified location. If the input field is left empty, the app will attempt to use the Geolocation API to fetch weather data based on the user's current location. The weather information, including the location name, temperature, and weather conditions, is then displayed on the screen.

The project requires an API key from OpenWeatherMap. Replace YOUR_API_KEY in the script.js file with your actual API key to enable the app to fetch data.
